UniData is a prominent educational institution dedicated to providing quality education through a wide array of courses, a diverse student body, and committed faculty members. This project focuses on designing and implementing a comprehensive database management system to streamline UniData's administrative processes, enhance operational efficiency, and ensure seamless data management.
The database system consists of 9 meticulously designed tables, each representing a unique entity, with carefully structured primary and foreign keys to establish robust relationships between them. Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), a large dataset was processed into a normalized relational database, and an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was developed to map the connections between the entities.
Additionally, a Dimensional Database was built using SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to support advanced reporting and data analysis. Complex SQL queries were crafted to extract insights and address analytical needs. This project not only demonstrates the effective handling of large datasets but also showcases the integration of relational and dimensional modeling for optimal database performance.

This repository includes the ERD, SQL queries, and analysis outputs that highlight the implementation and benefits of the UniData database system.
